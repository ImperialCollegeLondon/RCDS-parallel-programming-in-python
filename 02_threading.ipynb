    "The ```threading``` library (documentation [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html)) is a library which (since Python 3.7) is included by default as part of the Python standard library.

    "## Threads\n",
    "A thread is a separate flow of execution within your code. Normally, Python executes on a single thread, but the ```threading``` library allows us to create multiple threads. This allows for there to be multiple point in a code where the code is currently being executed. Each thread will have access to the same memory space, so they can share data between them.\n",

We can also pass arguments to the function by writing ```args=``` and then a tuple containing the arguments in the argument list.\n",
    "\n",

Firstly, when we examine the order of the output, we may see that a thread that is started later may overtake a thread that started earlier, despite them each running identical code.

These two observations are due to the way that CPU time is allocated to threads, which is controlled by the operating system. This means we cannot guarantee the order in which threads will execute. This is a common feature of concurrent programming, and is something we will need to be aware of when writing concurrent code.\n",

In each of these threads, the global variable ```results``` will be accessed and modified. In that case, each thread was accessing a different entry in ```results``` and so the different threads didn't interfere with each other. However, if multiple threads are accessing the same data, there can be problems where the threads interfere with each other. This is known as a race condition. For example, in the code below, we write a function which increases the value of the global variable ```x``` by the thread number.

For instance, the code below applies a series of 8 different functions to an array of ```n``` numbers.

This is something the example above likely doesn't do perfectly.\n",

This means that even the single-threaded version of the code is already running multiple operations concurrently. This means that the speedup we get from using multiple threads is less than it would be if we were running code that was not already parallelized. This also means that trying to use threading to speed up a single Numpy operation is not normally effective as Numpy is already using multiple threads in a near optimal way. However, if there are several different Numpy operations which need to be run, then threading can allow them to be performed concurrently with at least some speedup.\n",

This \"free-threaded\" version of Python is intended to be bypass the limitations we've seen above. However, it it is currently around 40% slower than the standard version of Python for single-threaded tasks and, as a result, this is not part of the standard Python 3.13 distribution. When I experimented with this, I found it difficult to get working. This feature may become easier to use and more important in the future."
