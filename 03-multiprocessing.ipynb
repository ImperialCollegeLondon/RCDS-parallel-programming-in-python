These are separate processes in the operating that have their own memory space. This means that sharing information between processes is more complicated than sharing information between threads. However, it also means that race conditions are less likely and, as each process is independent, the GIL is not a problem. This allows for code to be executed in parallel."

This is because it is being run in a separate process and so its output is not captured and displayed by the Jupyter notebook. A copy of this code is found in the file [```03_multiprocessing_scripts/print_example.py```](03_multiprocessing_scripts/print_example.py). You can run this code and see that the output of all processes is captured by the terminal and displayed there.\n",

Once we have more than one child process, we will need to create a pipe for each pair of processes that need to communicate, further increasing complexity."
