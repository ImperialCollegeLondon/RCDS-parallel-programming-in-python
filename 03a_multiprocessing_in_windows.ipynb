    "## How Windows Differs from Linux\n",
    "\n",
    "In Windows, processes are created using the `spawn` method rather than the `fork` method used on Linux. This is a fundamental difference with important implications for how you write multiprocessing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Spawn Method\n",
    "\n",
    "When Windows spawns a new process, it starts a fresh Python interpreter and re-imports the main module from scratch. This means:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The entire script runs again in each child process** - Unlike Linux where child processes inherit a snapshot of the parent's memory, Windows child processes start fresh and execute the module-level code from the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Top-level code executes in every process** - Any code that isn't protected will run once in the parent process and again in each child process, potentially causing infinite recursion if you're creating a processes in that top-level code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Functions and data must be importable** - The target functions and any data structures you pass to child processes need to be defined at module level (not inside `if __name__ == '__main__':` blocks) so they can be imported by the child processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `if __name__ == '__main__':` Guard\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why the `if __name__ == '__main__':` guard is essential on Windows. When the main module is imported by a child process, `__name__` will be set to the module name (not `'__main__'`), so code inside the guard won't execute in child processes. This prevents infinite process spawning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what happens without the guard on Windows:"

    "2. **Define functions at module level** (outside the guard) so child processes can import them\n",
    "3. **Keep data initialization inside the guard** when possible, or be aware that it will be re-executed in Windows child processes\n",
    "\n",

If you want to run those examples on Windows, you'll need to add the appropriate guards around the process-creation code."
