    "## The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to simulate a population of cells over time. The cells have an average lifetime, but the actual time a cell will live is random. If $l$ is the lifetime of a cell, then the probability density function that a cell will die at time $t$ after its birth is given by: \n",
    "\n",
    "$P(t) = \\textrm{e}^{-\\frac{t}{l}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a cell will ends its life, it will either die or split into two cells. In our simulation, we'll use a mean lifetime of 1, and we'll assume the cell has a probability of splitting of 0.55 and a probability of dying of 0.45. As the time of death of each cell and the fate of each cell is non-deterministic, the same starting conditions will lead to different outcomes each time the simulation is run.\n",
    "\n",
    "As cells are more likely to split than to die, on average, the population will grow as in the figure below:\n",

    "## Serial Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "We can simulate this problem by running a number of different realisations of the simulation. Each of these realisations will be an independent simulation of a possible history of the population of cells as a function of time. Once we have run many realisations, we can use the collection of realisations to calculate the mean and standard deviation of the population at each time, as well as the survival probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "A serial realisation of the simulation can be found in [`06_cell_population_example/serial_version.py`](06_cell_population_example/serial_version.py). We don't need to look into the details of most of the functions, but it's worth understanding what each function does:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `generate_next_population`: This function calculates the number of cells that will be present at a certain time after the current time for a single cell. This uses a random number generator to determine if a cell will die, split, or survive the time period.\n",
    "- `run_realisation`: This function runs a single realisation of the simulation. It starts with a single cell at time 0 and calculates the population at each of a number of output times using `generate_next_population`.\n",
    "- `run_single_realisation`: This function runs a single realisation of the system using `run_realisation` and then calculates the mean and plots the output.\n",
    "- `run_multiple_realisations`: This function runs several realisations of the system using `run_single_realisation` and then calculates the mean and standard deviation of the population at each time, as well as the survival probability.\n",

    "The script contain code which runs two single realisations - one which always dies out and one which always grows (the results are guaranteed by manually choosing the seed of the random number generator). The script then runs 200 realisations of the system. Each realisation receives the number of the realisation (from 0-199) as a seed to ensure reproducibility. The runtimes of the system are printed to the console. When I ran the code, the output was:\n",

    "## Queue Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is a god candidate for parallelisation as each realisation is independent of the others. As each realisation can take a while to run, it also means the overhead due to communication is likely to be small compared to the time taken to run the realisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we parallelise the code, we want to keep the interface for the functions a user might call as similar as possible, specifically, `run_single_realisation` and `run_multiple_realisations`. This means it will take minimal effort adapt existing tests and profiling, and any users running the code, or any places where the code is called in existing projects will not need to be changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first attempt to parallelising the code is to use a queue to store te results produced from a number of realisations in the file [`06_cell_population_example/queue_version.py`](06_cell_population_example/queue_version.py). To do this we create the new function `run_n_realisation_queue` which is similar to the old function `run_multiple_realisations` but uses a queue to store the results of all realisations performed in a 2D Numpy array. This function will be called by each process. The function `run_multiple_realisations` is adapted to create the queue, start the processes, collect the results from the queue, and process the results. Each process returns a 2D Numpy array with the population at each time for each realisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "When altering `run_multiple_realisations` we have made the number of processes an optional argument with a default value of 1. This means that calls made to the function without specifying the number of processes will still work, making integration of the new function into existing projects easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation doesn't alter the runtime of the single realisations, but decreases the runtime from around 189s to around 107s on 4 cores. This is a decent speedup, but the code is not 4 times faster. Part of the reason for this becomes apparent when we run the code and view which process is working on each realisation, as in the figure below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "<img src=\"resources/queue_runtimes.png\" alt=\"The amount of time each process spent running realisations using a Queue.\" class=\"center\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, Process 4 was running realisations 150-199, which happened to not include many realisations where the population grew and so finished in 26s. Processes 2 and 3 had more long-lived realisations and took 76s and 80s to run respectively. Process 1 happened to have several long-lived realisations and took 107s to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a process has finished its realisations it will terminate and the physical core will be inactive. The code is left waiting for the slowest process to finish, meaning progressively fewer of the cores are active as the code runs. This is a common problem when parallelising code, and is known as load imbalance. Ideally, we would like a way to keep our processes busy for more of the time to make the overall calculation finish faster."

    "## Pool Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the problem of load imbalance, we can use a `Pool`. The advantage of a pool is that it will keep all the processes busy by assigning them new tasks as they finish their previous task. This means processes will be kept busy for more of the time, and the overall calculation will finish faster. This is implemented in the file [`06_cell_population_example/pool_version.py`](06_cell_population_example/pool_version.py).\n",
    "\n",
    "This version is arguably simpler than the queue version as we don't need to have a function like `run_n_realisation_queue` to use as an interface between `run_multiple_realisations` and `run_single_realisation`. Instead, we can use the `starmap` function from the `Pool` object to run the realisations. Once we receive the results from the `Pool` object, we can process them into a 2D Numpy array and process them as before.\n",

    "## Deterministic Approximation\n",
    "\n",
    "We've seen how we can parallelise the code and this significantly speeds it up. But we can speed up a single realisation. We can note that the runtime of the code is strongly related to the number of cells simulated and most of the cells in a realisation are simulated at the end of a growing simulation when the population is high. If we look back at the figure at the start of the notebook showing how the population grows over time in a single realisation, we also note that the growth in population is smooth and deterministic once the population exceeds about 10,000 neutrons. This means we can use a deterministic approximation to calculate the population at these times, rather than simulating each cell individually.\n",

    "The file [`06_cell_population_example/deterministic_version.py`](06_cell_population_example/deterministic_version.py) contains the implementation of this approximation. The function `run_realisation` has been adapted so the loop over the different times exits when the population exceeds 10,000 cells. When this happens a simple Numpy calculation is used to calculate the population of the remaining times. \n",
