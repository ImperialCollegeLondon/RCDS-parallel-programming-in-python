# Core dependencies for parallel programming course
# Note: mpi4py should be built from source to correctly link against
# the MPI libraries on your system. In the devcontainer, MPICH is
# installed via apt and mpi4py is compiled from source using:
#   pip install --no-binary mpi4py mpi4py
# For manual installation outside the devcontainer:
#   1) Install MPICH (or OpenMPI) for your OS
#   2) pip install --no-binary mpi4py mpi4py
#   3) pip install -r requirements.txt
# Important: mpi4py is intentionally NOT listed below to avoid
# accidental binary wheel installs. Install it separately from source
# as shown above, then install the remaining packages.
