# Core dependencies for parallel programming course
# Note: mpi4py must be built from source to properly link against MPI libraries
# on your system. The pip.ini file in this directory configures this automatically.
# If you don't have a pip.ini, you can install with:
#   pip install --no-binary :all: mpi4py
#   pip install -r requirements.txt
