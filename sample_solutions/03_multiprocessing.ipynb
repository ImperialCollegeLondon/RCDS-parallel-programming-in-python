    "In this sample solution, the points are divided amonst all of the processes as evenly as possible. `count_points_inside_circle` is called in each process and returns the number of its points that are inside the circle by adding them to a `Queue`. These values are retrieved from the `Queue` (note that we don't need to wait with `join` as `Queue.get` waits for each item to be added to the `Queue`). The total of these values is calcualted, and then used to estimate a value of $\\pi$."

The `starmap` is implemented using a `Pool` and the returned values are summed to give the final answer."
